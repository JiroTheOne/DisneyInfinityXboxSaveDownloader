* Offical Xbox app from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MV0B5HZVK9Z)
* A Microsoft Account with Disney Infinity Xbox cloud saves (Xbox One/Series S/X not 360)

### Known issues (from project spark doc):
* sometimes, app gets confiused when there are multiple saved credentials with the same name. a guide on how to get the app working is being written while a fix for this issue is found.

## How to use:
1. Download the latest release from [github](https://github.com/JiroTheOne/DisneyInfinityXboxSaveDownloader/releases)
2. Install the Xbox app from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MV0B5HZVK9Z)
3. Open the Xbox app and make sure you are logged in with the correct Xbox Profile
4. Run the app and select a empty output folder
5. Click download and wait for it to finish
6. Since the downloads will include your user Saves and Toyboxes you should only share the \*RR\* files with the Disney Infinity community.
7. If you want to use your Toyboxes on Disney Infinity Gold Editions you will need to copy the files to `%AppData%\Disney Interactive\Disney Infinity 3.0\<unique-id>\SavedGame\user0\`
8. Enjoy your toyboxes!

## How do I support this project?
We've borrowed this code from the great work of the Project Spark preservation team [Discord](https://discord.gg/zGGpFp8fSm).
Like their project, this one is also purely out of love for the game and is an action in answer to the massive amounts of games and creations that we endeavour to preserve.
The best action you can take is to join the Disney Infinity [Discord](https://discord.gg/RWSt8xnZGy) and share your downloaded and created worlds.
We want to save as much as possible of the history of this game. you can find me in the discord for more information about the future of this project.
